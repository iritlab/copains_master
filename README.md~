# Procedure for compile and run the program

For compile the different modules :
       ../planer/make
       ../brev/make
       ../translations/dune build

Data shared by all the modules is stored in ../sdata : 
       * Axioms 
       * Initial State
       * Actions
       * Goal, etc 
       
The GUI for the chatbot contains a directory ../chatbot/solvedatacp
where the files generated by the planning process are stored.
