(** [push_lit] allows to translate into CNF the non-CNF disjunction [d or cnf]
    ([d] is the literal we want to add, [cnf] is the existing CNF form).
    For example:
    {[
          d  or  ((a or not b) and (not c))            <- is not in CNF
    <=>   push_lit (d) ((a or not b) and not c)
    <=>   (d or a or b) and (d or not c)               <- is in CNF
    ]}
    This function is necessary because [d or cnf] (with [cnf] an arbitrary CNF
    form) is not a CNF form and must be modified. Conversely, the form
          [d  and  ((a or not b) and (not c))]
    doesn't need to be modified because it is already in CNF.  *)

(** Actual logic of [ast_to_cnf]
    [depth] tells what is the current level of recursion and
    helps for debugging the translation to CNF.
    [stop] tells to_cnf if it should stop or continue the recursion.

    - (1) When transforming to CNF, we want to make sure that "outer" to_cnf
        transformations are made before inner ones. For example, in
        {v
            to_cnf (Not (to_cnf ((a and b) => c)))
        v}
        we want to limit the inner [to_cnf] expansion to let the possibily for
        the outer to_cnf to "simplify" with the Not as soon as possible.
        For inner [to_cnf], we simply use [to_cnf_once] to prevent the inner
        [to_cnf] from recursing more than once.
    - (2) All bottom and top must disappear for the CNF transformation; we use
        the standard transformation to remove them (a and not a, b or not b) *)
