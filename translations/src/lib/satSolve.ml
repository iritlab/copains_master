(* 1. Prevent current model from reappearing
   =========================================
   We must prevent the current model to reappear in future models;
   to do so, we add a clause that take the negation of the valuations
   E.g: with the model a=1, b=0 we must add the clause -a or b.
   [counter_clause] will produce a list of literals that corresponds
   to this clause. [counter_current_model] then adds the clause to the problem.
   IMPORTANT: When adding the counter-clause, the problem can become unsat.
   [counter_current_model] returns false if the added clause makes the
   formula unsat right away. *)

(* 2. Avoid duplicates caused by fake literals (of the form '&6')
   ==============================================================
   Our issue here: the models contain fake '&12' literals. We don't
   want to see these fake literals in our models; we also want to
   remove the duplicate models linked to these fake literals.
   To avoid those duplicates, we store the models (without the fake
   literals) in a set.

   To use this function, you need a ModelSet ref already initialized, e.g. with
    let models = ref ModelSet.empty *)

(* 3. Fetch the models
   ===================
   Basically, we
    (1) compute a model with Minisat.solve
    (2) check if we already saw this model (duplicates because of &23 literals)
    (3) prevent the same model from reappearing in adding the clause where all
        lits are the negation of the valuation in the model
    (4) go on with (1)
